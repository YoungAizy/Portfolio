  "content": "Hi there!\n\nMeet your coding buddy Ayanda Marotya. I am a Full Stack developer with hands on experience in web and android mobile development.  My first love is Java (React.js being a close second) and alongside it my passion to design optimised solutions with eye-catching designs. I love new challenges and learning new stuff and therefore I'm always looking to expand my knowledge of the tech world and refine my skill.\n\nHave a look at the `projects` section and send me an email if my work impresses you. I am looking forward to hearing from you, and hopefully working together :)"
